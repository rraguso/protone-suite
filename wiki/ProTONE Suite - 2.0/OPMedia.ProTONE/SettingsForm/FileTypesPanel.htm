            This page of the Settings Dialog is used to configure 
            (activate/deactivate) the integration with the Windows Explorer. </p>
        <p>
            When the integration is activated, the user can also be used to define which file types are handled by the application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio files: The user can select/deselect individual audio files, or all audio 
                files can be selected/deselected by using the buttons at the bottom of this 
                panel</li>
            <li>Video files: The user can select/deselect individual video files, or all video 
                files can be selected/deselected by using the buttons at the bottom of this 
                panel</li>
            <li>Playlist files: The user can select/deselect individual playlist files, or all 
                playlist files can be selected/deselected by using the buttons at the bottom of 
                this panel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            When the Windows Explorer Integration is activated, the Windows Explorer (or any 
            other application that implements the Windows Shell interfaces, e.g. Total 
            Commander or Free Commander) will add the options &quot;Play with ProTONE player&quot; or 
            &quot;Enqueue in ProTONE player&quot; to the context menu shown when a file system entry 
            is right-clicked in Windows Explorer, like in the screenshot below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/filetypespanel_explorer_cm.png" 
                style="height: 528px; width: 358px"/></p>
        <p>
            These context menu entries are hence shown:
            <ul>
                <li>When the Windows Explorer Integration is activated, AND ...</li>
                <li>The selected entries represent valid media entries, meaning that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The entry is a valid media file (i.e. it is checked in the corresponding list in this panel)</li>
                        <li>The entry is a disk or a folder that contain valid media files, or one of its subfolders (at most 3 levels deep) contains valid media files</li>
                        <li>The entry is an Audio CD disk, or a Video DVD disk</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    
            </ul>
        Also, the user can define how should the application open the media files that 
        are launched (that is - double clicked with mouse, or selected then pressed 
        Enter key) from Windows Explorer. The options are to:
        <ul>
                <li>Enqueue the files at the end of current playlist (default option)</li>
                <li>Play the files, replacing current playlist</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

==KB-0001==

*Affected Operating Systems:*

Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP1

*Condition:*

.NET Framwork 4.0 not previously installed

*Symptoms:*

ProTONE Suite setup cannot be completed because of the .NET Framework 4.0 setup that requires Windows Imaging Component (WIC) to be installed first.

If the user installs WIC following the indications, .NET Framework 4.0 is succesfully installed, however ProTONE Suite Setup still sees .NET Framework 4.0 as not installed.

*Workaround sequence:*

1. Abort the ProTONE Suite setup that permanently gives .NET Framework errors.

2. Open *%TEMP%* folder in Windows Explorer. 

3. Locate *ProTONE Suite `<version`>.exe* and launch it manually.
